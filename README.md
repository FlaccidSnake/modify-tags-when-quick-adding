# Modify Tags When Quick Adding

An Anki addon that adds a "Modify and add to selected notes" option to the tag context menu in the browser sidebar.

## Usage

1. Select one or more notes in the Anki browser
2. Right-click on a tag in the sidebar
3. Click "Modify and add to selected notes" (third option in the menu)
4. Edit the tag in the dialog that appears
5. Click OK to add the modified tag to all selected notes

## Use Case

I add tags from the browser sidebar a lot, and my workflow loop involved far too many clicks: right clicking and adding the tag, then going to the Search and Replace Tag addon to modify the tag I just added. 
This streamlines the process.
